Installing the above MCP servers was rather quick and server, but other MCP servers might also require you to install other developer tools and packages, as well as generating appropriate API keys. Configuring those MCP servers create quite a bottleneck to the operation. Ultimately, with the help of AI and a lot of debugging, I was slowly working towards setting the right configuration.
